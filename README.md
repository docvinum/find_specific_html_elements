# HTML Element Finder

## Overview
This Python script, `find_specific_html_elements.py`, is designed to scan a range of webpages for a specific HTML element. It is particularly useful for web scraping and data mining tasks where you need to find occurrences of a particular element across multiple pages.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Web Requests**: Utilizes `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for non-blocking web requests.
- **HTML Parsing**: Employs `BeautifulSoup` to parse and search through the HTML content.
- **Multiprocessing**: Distributes the workload across multiple CPU cores for enhanced performance.
- **Customizable Search**: Allows users to specify the element to search for and the range of pages.
- **Output to CSV**: Saves the URLs of pages where the element is found in a CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `aiohttp`
- `beautifulsoup4`

## Installation
To install the required packages, run:
```
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage
Run the script with the necessary arguments. For example:
```
python find_specific_html_elements.py --base-url "https://example.com/" --start 1 --end 100 --html-element "div" --output-file "results.csv"
```
